This is my first time practising building a data pipeline. Special thanks to the tutorial video of CodeWithYu: https://youtu.be/divjURi-low?list=PL_Ct8Cox2p8UlTfHyJc3RDGuGktPNs9Q3 

In this project, I setup and end to end data engineering using Apache Spark, Azure Databricks, Data Build Tool (DBT) using Azure as our cloud provider. This project illustrate the process of data ingestion to the lakehouse, data integration with ADF and data transformation with Databricks, and DBT.
